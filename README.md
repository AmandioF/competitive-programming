## Notes and courses for competitive programming

### Courses for competitive programming

1. [Algo.is](http://algo.is) is a competitive programming course taught by [Bjarki Ágúst Guðmundsson](https://github.com/SuprDewd) also known as SuprDewd (via Codeforces) and Tómas Ken Magnússon. C++ is used as programming language. The website includes an online judge. The material is available on GitHub.

2. [Brabble](https://github.com/paul-g/brabble) is an introductory course on competitive programming taught by [Paul Grigoras](https://github.com/paul-g). Java is used in this course.

3. [CS 97SI](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs97si/) is an introductory course on competitive programming taught by [Jaehyun Park](http://www.stanford.edu/~liszt90/)

4. [Competitive programming](https://sites.google.com/site/stevenhalim/home/material) taught by [Steven Halim](https://sites.google.com/site/stevenhalim/). The first edition of his book can be downloaded [here](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~stevenha/myteaching/competitive_programming/cp1.pdf).

5. [CSE 232: Programming Skills Workshop](https://acm.wustl.edu/cse232/) taught by Brett Olsen.

6. [CSE 390 B, ACM Programming Contest Preparation](http://www.martystepp.com/acm/) by Marty Stepp.

7. [The Art of Programming Contest](http://www.ahmedshamsularefin.id.au/acm-icpc/tutorials/30-my-articles) is a book (pdf [here](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~stevenha/database/Art_of_Programming_Contest_SE_for_uva.pdf)) written by [Ahmed Shamsul Arefin](http://www.newcastle.edu.au/profile/ahmed-arefin).

8. [Coursera : Data Structures and Algorithms]https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms This specialization is a mix of theory and practice: you will learn algorithmic techniques for solving various computational problems and will implement about 100 algorithmic coding problems in a programming language of your choice.
